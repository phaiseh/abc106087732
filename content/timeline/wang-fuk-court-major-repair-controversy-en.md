## 3. Tender Process Details and Suspicious Points

Despite using the URA "Smart Tender" platform, the tender process and results contain multiple serious irregularities, triggering allegations of bid-rigging.

### 3.1 Basic Tender Data and Estimates
*   **URA Independent Estimate**: Approx. **HKD 1.44 billion** (core works).
*   **Consultant (Will Power) Estimate**: Approx. **HKD 1.55 billion**.
*   **Macro Construction Bid**: Approx. **HKD 1.52 billion** (core works).
*   Consultant and some media described the bid as "within professional estimates".[^11][^14]

### 3.2 Discrepancy in Risk Rating and Litigation Record
In the August 2023 report, the consultant rated the risks of contractors:
*   **High Risk Ratio**: Out of 57 bidders, **47 companies (approx. 82%)** were rated C to E "High Risk".[^11]
*   **Macro's Rating**: Macro was listed as one of the few **Grade A risk, best background** contractors.
*   **Missing Records**: The report stated Macro had **"No record"** under "Past 8-year litigation" and "Suspected bid-rigging/corruption", thus awarding it full background score of **20 points**.[^9][^15]

**Gap between Fact and Record**:
Media and public records show Macro has multiple controversial records:
*   **King Tin Court Case**: Was a defendant in a civil lawsuit where owners alleged bid-rigging and unreasonable costs (though not ruled as excessive pricing, the litigation itself is a known record).[^7]
*   **Safety Record**: Between 2022–2025, prosecuted **at least 10 times** for safety violations; license temporarily suspended; disciplined by Buildings Department in 2023.[^8][^7]
*   **Question**: The blatant mismatch between the consultant report and public records is seen as the core irregularity of the tender.[^15][^9]

### 3.3 Scoring Discrepancy: Consultant vs OC
Internal documents reveal a huge gap in how the Consultant and the OC evaluated Macro:[^9]
*   **Consultant Score**: Gave Macro **90/100** in the interview, commenting it "basically demonstrated sufficient capability and professional standard".
*   **OC Score**: The OC's own interview score for Macro was only **57/100**, classified as "Needs Improvement".
*   **Result**: Despite the OC's low score, Macro was ranked in the **top 5** by the consultant and ultimately won the bid.

### 3.4 ICAC Investigation and Material Fraud
Post-fire investigations by ICAC and the government revealed further issues:
*   **Corruption Probe**: ICAC arrested directors of the consultant (Will Power), Macro executives, and middlemen, alleging bribery in the tendering and execution process.[^17][^18]
*   **Non-compliant Netting**: Government testing found **7 out of 20 samples** of protective netting failed fire retardancy standards.[^20]
*   **Material Swapping**: ICAC alleged that after a typhoon in July 2025, **2,300 rolls of non-compliant netting** were purchased for replacement. Later, to pass inspections, **155 rolls of compliant netting** were bought to "mix in".[^18]

## 4. Conduct and Controversy of the Old OC (11th/12th MC)

### 4.1 Defense of Procedural Compliance
Supporters and advisors of the Old OC emphasize they followed procedures:
*   Legally appointed registered inspectors and independent consultants.
*   Used the URA "Smart Tender" platform.
*   Formally passed the scheme at the Jan 2024 Owners' Meeting.
*   Trimmed some cosmetic items (e.g., clear coating) in March 2025 to save approx. HKD 15 million.[^4][^12]

### 4.2 Questioned Behaviors
However, residents and concern groups raise multiple allegations:
1.  **Choice of Problematic Contractor**: Accepted the consultant's "no record" report despite Macro's known safety and bid-rigging controversy, without independent verification.[^7][^15]
2.  **Excessive Cost**: The HKD 3.3 billion total cost (HKD 150k-190k per household) was criticized as "sky-high", with some cosmetic works deemed unnecessary.[^16][^22]
3.  **Lack of Transparency**: Explanations of scope and alternatives were overly technical, forcing residents to rely on civil groups (e.g., Anti-Bid-Rigging Alliance) for analysis.[^21]
4.  **Resistance to Meetings**: Residents had to make multiple efforts to successfully convene the Special Owners' Meeting to revoke the OC.[^13]
5.  **Political Connections**: DAB District Councillor Wong Pik-kiu served as OC consultant, actively promoting the scheme and criticizing opposition, creating a perceived "Consultant-Contractor-Party" high-risk governance model.[^16][^24]

## 5. Establishment and Conduct of the New OC (Current)

### 5.1 Background of Establishment
Dissatisfied with high costs, bid-rigging suspicions, and political interference, owners invoked the *Building Management Ordinance* to convene a Special Owners' Meeting in **September 2024**, voting by a large majority to revoke the Old OC and elect the New OC led by Tsui Mun-kam.[^6][^13]

### 5.2 Actions and Limitations
*   **Inherited Contract**: Took office after the contract was signed and works started (Signed Apr 2024, Started Jul 2024), limiting ability to cancel.[^21]
*   **Monitoring Pledge**: Promised to re-examine terms and monitor progress. Contractor promised to accelerate works and start dismantling scaffolding in early 2026.[^10]
*   **Third-Party Supervisor Controversy**: The New OC discussed hiring an independent third-party supervisor but repeatedly delayed it due to "high cost" and "unsuitability".[^5]

### 5.3 Criticisms of the New OC
After the fire, the New OC also faced allegations of ineffective supervision:
1.  **Failure to Address Simultaneous Works**: Despite warnings from residents and unions that scaffolding on 8 blocks simultaneously was dangerous, the New OC failed to negotiate a phased approach.[^5]
2.  **Inadequate Safety Follow-up**: Aware of complaints about fire alarms and safety devices, but did not personally test them or take strong measures.[^5]
3.  **Over-reliance**: Chairman Tsui admitted he was not a professional and only "asked the contractor" about netting standards, which was criticized as passive.[^5]

## 6. Role and Controversy of Wong Pik-kiu

### 6.1 Role Before Fire
*   **Identity**: DAB District Councillor for Tai Po South (covering Wang Fuk Court), Consultant to the Old OC.
*   **Actions**: Actively defended the HKD 3.3 billion repair, urged residents to support the Old OC, and criticized anti-bid-rigging activists as "spreading rumors".[^16][^23]

### 6.2 Actions After Fire
Wong's post-fire statements sparked significant controversy:
1.  **Downplaying Role**: Initially claimed she was "unclear about progress" and even said Wang Fuk Court was "not covered by me", which was exposed as contradicting electoral data and her consultant term.[^13][^25]
2.  **"Man-made Disaster"**: Described the fire as a "man-made disaster" caused by years of neglecting safety.[^30]
3.  **Reporting Current OC**: Reported the **Current OC** to police and ICAC for alleged dereliction of duty and concealing risks, emphasizing she knew nothing after stepping down as consultant.[^25][^32]

### 6.3 Points of Controversy
*   **Supporters**: DAB stated they would not tolerate illegal acts but emphasized the party did not participate in tendering. Wong claimed her report was to pursue responsibility for residents.
*   **Opponents**: Fact-checks show she was consultant when the scheme was approved. Public opinion criticizes her for targeting the New OC (in office for only 1 year) as an attempt to shift blame and distract attention.[^10][^21]
